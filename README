This solutions is based on psqldroid patches downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/psqldroid/downloads/list

The original instructions were:

	download & configure the Android source tree
	download postgresql-8.4.1
	download the psqldroid patch
	extract the postgres archive and move the directory to external/postgresql
		under your Android source tree
	change into the external/postgresql directory
	apply the psqldroid patch
	run 'sh create-symbolic-links.sh'
	change to the root of the android source tree
	make psql 

	Notes:
		This is known to work with the Android Donut release, but probably others as well
		Once the compilation completes, you will find binaries under target/out/... 

What I (csjpeter@gmail.com) did:

	unpacked the downloaded psqldroid-20100106.patch.gz and renamed the created
			directoy postgresql to postgresql-droid
	I checked out postgresql git repository
			git clone git://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git
	stepped in and created a branch named psqldroid_8.4
			git checkout -t -b psqldroid_8.4 origin/REL8_4_STABLE
	applied the patch by
		for f in $(find ../postgresql-droid/ | grep "\.diff$"); do patch -p1 < $f; done
	run create-symbolic-links.sh and then removed it
		bash create-symbolic-links.sh && rm create-symbolic-links.sh
	and added new files created so far
			git add -f .
			(some were ignored by gitignores I guess because those
			were to be generated in some way)
	made a git commit, so the rest can be tracked in git log

For compiling you will need android SDK, NDK.
Set your ANDROID_HOME to your android sdk path.
Also you will need openssl-android. You should put its git repo next to your postgresql directory.
	git clone https://github.com/scottt/openssl-android.git
	It had last commit id 98ea02b773a647e2fd935bee50fdaa310b7f447d when I was checking it out.
Now you can try to compile by using 'ndk-build' script from you android NDK directory.

PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================
  
This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

	http://www.postgresql.org/download

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Changes between all PostgreSQL releases are recorded in the
file HISTORY.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
http://www.postgresql.org/download/.  For more information look at our
web site located at http://www.postgresql.org/.
